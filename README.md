Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict stock prices using historical market data. It utilizes a Random Forest Regressor to forecast future stock prices for selected companies, incorporating data from Amazon (AMZN), Dominoâ€™s Pizza (DPZ), Bitcoin (BTC), and Netflix (NFLX). The project is built using Streamlit, allowing users to interactively visualize predictions.

Features

Historical Data Processing: Loads and processes stock price data from CSV.

Machine Learning Model: Implements a Random Forest Regressor for price prediction.

Interactive UI with Streamlit:

Users can select the stock to predict.

Adjustable forecast horizon (1 to 30 days).

Dynamic visualization with Plotly.

Synthetic Data Extension: Generated stock data from 2019 to 2025 for complete analysis.

Performance Evaluation: Calculates and displays the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the model.

Dataset

The dataset contains stock price data from 2013 to 2025, where 2019-2025 data is synthetically generated using a random walk approach based on past trends.

Installation & Usage

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/manishmanimidipally/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Streamlit App:

streamlit run app.py

Upload Your Own Dataset (Optional): Replace stock_data.csv with your own dataset.

Future Improvements

Incorporate Deep Learning: Use LSTM or Transformer models for better accuracy.

Enhance Feature Engineering: Include technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD).

Live Data Fetching: Integrate APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the Random Forest model.
